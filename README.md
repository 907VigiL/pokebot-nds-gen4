# Pokébot NDS
This repository is dedicated to creating a multi-purpose automated tool for the mainline DS Pokémon games. Reported [issues](https://github.com/wyanido/pokebot-nds/issues) or contributions in any form are heavily appreciated, as making this project widely compatible takes a lot of work.

## Getting started
Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/wyanido/pokebot-nds/wiki) for more information on how to use the bot, including the setup process.
